How do you implement prism.js?Prism is a popular syntax highlighting library for web projects that can be easily implemented in a few steps. Here's a simple guide on how to add Prism.js to your HTML project:

1. **Download Prism.js**: Visit the [Prism.js download page](https://prismjs.com/download.html) and select the languages you want to include. After selecting, click "Download" to get a ZIP file containing the necessary files.

2. **Extract the files**: Extract the ZIP file. You will find a `prism.js` file and a `prism.css` file inside the `themes` directory.

3. **Add Prism.js and Prism.css to your HTML project**:

- Copy the `prism.js` file to your project's directory (or any subdirectory where you prefer to keep JavaScript files).
- Copy the `prism.css` file to your project's directory (or any subdirectory where you prefer to keep CSS files), or include it in the `<head>` section of your HTML using a link tag, like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/prism.css">
```

Replace `/path/to/prism.css` with the actual path to the `prism.css` file in your project.

4. **Include Prism.js in your HTML**: Add the following script tag to the bottom of your HTML's `<body>` section:

```html
<script src="/path/to/prism.js"></script>
```

Replace `/path/to/prism.js` with the actual path to the `prism.js` file in your project.

5. **Highlight code blocks**: To highlight a code block, wrap it with `<pre>` and `<code>` tags, and add the language class to the `<code>` tag. For example:

```html
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function helloWorld() {
console.log("Hello, world!");
}
</code></pre>
```

This will highlight the code block as JavaScript.

That's it! You have now set up Prism for syntax highlighting in your HTML files.
